# Final Project of Software Engineering
![picture](src/main/resources/graphics/backgrounds/menu.jpg)
 
## Getting Started
Java implementation of the table game Eriantys by the italian company Cranio Creations as part of the Bachelor of Science thesis. This is formally part of the Software Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano (A.Y. 2021 / 2022).
The aim of this project is the design and realization of a distributed client-server software based on object-oriented programming, using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design model. 

More information about the game can be found [here](https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/eriantys)

## Prerequisites
The game requires [Java 17] to run and you can find the link below on the built section. 

## Features
The features we have realised are listed in the following section:
### Features developed
* Regole Base
* Regole Complete
* Socket
* CLI
* GUI
* Carte Personaggio
* Partite Multiple
* Resilienza alle disconnessioni
